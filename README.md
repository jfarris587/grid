# Custom Flexbox Grid System

This is a custom made grid system using flexbox. The base system mimics the typical grids like Bootstrap having conventional 12 columns in rows. However, with this grid, it can be changed with variables. The number of columns can be increased or decreased, and the max-width of containers can be changed for responsiveness only by changing the container variable.
